## Class 1: Basic principles

### Jacob and Monod, J. Mol. Biol. 3: 318-356 (1961) [\[pdf\]](pdfs/jacob_monod.pdf)

_A seminal work of innovative synthesis, providing the intellectual foundation for the study of gene regulation._  

This work has played such a large role in the conceptualization of gene regulatory phenomena extending over many decades that we will be stepping through the key points of the paper sequentially.  The high-level themes/questions to consider are:

1. What is the relative importance assigned to positive (activator) vs. negative (repressor) regulation?
2. What logic supports Jacob and Monod’s conception of ‘messenger RNA’?
3. How do kinetic (vs. qualitative yes/no) experiments influence how Jacob and Monod conceptualize and development key problems of gene regulation?
