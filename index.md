### Jacob and Monod, J. Mol. Biol. 3: 318-356 (1961)

_A seminal work of innovative synthesis, providing the intellectual foundation for the study of gene regulation._  

This work has played such a large role in the conceptualization of gene regulatory phenomena extending over many decades that we will be stepping through the key points of the paper sequentially.  The high-level themes/questions to consider are:

1. What is the relative importance assigned to positive (activator) vs. negative (repressor) regulation?
2. What logic supports Jacob and Monod’s conception of ‘messenger RNA’?
3. How do kinetic (vs. qualitative yes/no) experiments influence how Jacob and Monod conceptualize and development key problems of gene regulation?

### Ptashne, Nature 214:232-5 (1967)
_This paper established that regulatory protein entities such as those discussed by Jacob and Monod were in fact DNA binding proteins._

1. Diagram the experiment
2. What are the experimental conditions and how could alterations in those conditions have affected the results?

------ 

### Weintraub and Groudine, Science 193:848-56 (1976)

_This seminal paper provided the first evidence for the role of chromatin structure in gene expression._

1. How do the authors introduce DNaseI into the nucleus? 
2. Describe the DNase I sensitivity assay as employed by the authors.  Could this be applied to any gene?
3. What do the authors. results suggest about the general organization of mammalian chromatin?
4. What prediction do the authors make concerning the spacial properties of gene expression in the nucleus?
